Aye Arr Arr: At Wit's End

Piracy is a risky business. 
It ain't easy flying the thickskull and bonehead flag---no matter how sweet that booty, every plunder costs ye blood, sweat, and tears. 
Or limbs. Or eyeballs.
And let's not start with those scurvy curs hanging about, aching to rob ye of yer rightfully plundered loot with their silly cannons!

So there'd better be something in it for ye, or else you wouldn't go on account now, would ye? Sink me!

Well, hold your water, matey. 
One thing sweetens the pot faster than grog washes yer worries away: that gamesome IRR (we speak of it as AYE ARR ARR). 
No matter how loud their irons bark, the IRR be yer trusty remedy. 
The IRR be what makes it worthy. 
The IRR be yer reward, matey!

So go on, batten down the hatches, me hearty, and get those returns right, or ye'll soon be telling no tales.
