Aye Arr Arr: At Wit's End

Piracy is a dangerous business. 
It ain't easy flying the thickskull and bonehead flag---no matter how sweet that booty, every plunder costs you blood, sweat, and tears. 
Or limbs. Or eyeballs.
And let's not start with those scurvy curs hanging about, aching to rob you of your rightfully plundered loot with their silly cannons!

So, is being a bucko worth it all? Well, there is only one thing that makes it right: that gamesome IRR (we speak of it as AYE ARR ARR). 
No matter how big their irons bark, the IRR be your hearty. 
So go on, batten down the hatches, matey, and get those returns right, or ye'll soon be telling no tales.
